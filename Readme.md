# NSBezierPath (ESPoints)
An Objective-C category on the NSBezierPath class. It provides the method `-drawPointsAndHandles` which draws handle control points as green circles, handles as green lines and anchor points as red squares.

The category is particularly useful when debugging Bézier Paths as it lets you see the underlying data with a single method call.
